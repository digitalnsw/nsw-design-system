  <h1>Testing display of HTML elements</h1>

  <h2>This is 2nd level heading</h2>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
  <h3>This is 3rd level heading</h3>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
  <h4>This is 4th level heading</h4>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
  <h5>This is 5th level heading</h5>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
  <h6>This is 6th level heading</h6>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>

  <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

  <p>This is a normal paragraph.
  To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was
  <a href="#">primarily written for testing</a> the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>.
  You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how
  your browser displays various HTML elements by default.
  It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML
  format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that
  the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected
  those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,
  in my opionion.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <h2>Lists</h2>

  <p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list. Note that
  the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
  to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
  logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One.</li>
    <li> Two.</li>
    <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that
  for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,
          whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
    <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.</li>
          Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list.
  In principle, such a list should consist of <em>terms</em> and associated
  definitions.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt> recursion</dt>
    <dd> see recursion</dd>
    <dt> recursion, indirect</dt>
    <dd> see indirect recursion</dd>
    <dt> indirect recursion</dt>
    <dd> see recursion, indirect</dd>
    <dt> term</dt>
    <dd> a word or other expression taken into specific use in
          a well-defined meaning, which is often defined rather rigorously, even
          formally, and may differ quite a lot from an everyday meaning</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Text-level markup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (an abbreviation)</li>
    <li> <acronym title="radio detecting and ranging">radar</acronym> (an acronym)</li>
    <li> <code>a[i] = b[i] + c[i);</code> (computer code)</li>
    <li> here we have some <del>deleted</del> text</li>
    <li> this is <em>very</em> simple (emphasizing a word)</li>
    <li> here we have some <ins>inserted</ins> text</li>
    <li> here we have some <strike>overstruck</strike> text</li>
    <li> <strong>this is strong text</strong></li>
    <li> Mathematical notations: e<sup>x</sup>, sin<sup>2</sup> <i>x</i>, e<sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup> and f(x)<sup>g(x)<sup>a+b+c</sup></sup></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace
  font, often using the <em>same</em> presentation for all of them. This
  tests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>

  <h2>Character test</h2>
      <p>The following table has some sample characters with
      annotations. If the browser&#8217;s default font does not
      contain all of them, they may get displayed using backup fonts.
      This may cause stylistic differences, but it should not
      prevent the characters from being displayed at all.</p>

      <table>
      <tr><th>Char. <th>Explanation <th>Notes
      <tr><td>ê <td>e with circumflex <td>Latin 1 character, should be ok
      <tr><td>&#8212; <td>em dash <td>Windows Latin 1 character, should be ok, too
      <tr><td>&#x100; <td>A with macron (line above) <td>Latin Extended-A character, not present in all fonts
      <tr><td>&Omega; <td>capital omega <td>A Greek letter
      <tr><td>&#x2212; <td>minus sign <td>Unicode minus
      <tr><td>&#x2300; <td>diameter sign <td>relatively rare in fonts
      </table>
