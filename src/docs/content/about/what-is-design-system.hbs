<p>The NSW Design System is a single source of truth for the design and development of digital products and services in NSW Government. Our mission is to help teams build products and services that meet user needs and deliver great user experiences.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/docs/content/design/getting-started.html" aria-label="Link to get started from a designers's standpoint with the NSW Design System">design guidelines</a> and <a href="/docs/content/develop/getting-started.html" aria-label="Link to get started from a developer's standpoint with the NSW Design System">development documentation</a> guide you on how to use the NSW Design System. Embracing a code first approach, all parts of the design system have been built in alignment to deliver simple and consistent solutions.</p>
<p>Building from a single, best practice base ensures consistency with how our users engage and interact with NSW Government digitally. Resulting in easy to use products and services.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<h3>Build faster and at scale</h3>
<p>Save time and money with an <a href="/docs/content/about/our-ecosystem.html" aria-label="Link to information about NSW Design System system ecosystem information">ecosystem</a> that is made to work together. The design system features a library of styles, components and templates, and well as advice and guidance for how and when to use each one. Delivered in ready to go UI and code kits, say goodbye to building from scratch.</p>

<h3>Out-of-the-box brand and accessibility compliance</h3>
<p>Understand, apply and meet brand standards, with features required for brand compliance indicated with a ðŸ”¹ blue diamond. Supporting the <a href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/branding" aria-label="Link to the NSW Branding team website" target="_blank">NSW Government Brand Framework</a>, the Design System can be used by (and bring value) to any brand classification. Our Design System has been updated to align with WCAG 2.2 level AA standards, providing components designed to support accessibility and inclusivity.</p>
<p>While these components are built to meet accessibility guidelines, achieving compliance for your product will depend on how they are integrated and used. Accessibility is influenced by your implementation choices including content creation, customisation and interaction design.</p>

<p>To maximise compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to accessibility best practices when implementing components.</li>
<li>Test your product with diverse users, including those with disabilities.</li>
<li>Regularly review and update your product to maintain accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>For additional support, explore our <a href="https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/accessibility-and-inclusivity-toolkit/courses" aria-label="Link to the Accessibility and Inclusivity Toolkit on the Digital NSW website" target="_blank">digital accessibility training resources</a>. Alternatively, contact <a href="mailto:digital@customerservice.nsw.gov.au">our team</a> for implementation advice.</p>

<h3>Design System Updates for WCAG 2.2 Compliance</h3>
