<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The utility list component simplifies user interaction by providing quick access to commonly used actions on content, including printing, downloading, copying, and sharing across different social media platforms.</p>
  
<p>It's important to create a utility list in a way that makes sense to users, matching their needs and what they'd expect in the page.</p>

<p>The utility list can be either vertical or horizontal in its orientation. By default, a utility list is vertical. The horizontal option should be used for when vertical space is limited.</p>

<h3>When to avoid</h3>
<p>While a utility list can be helpful in many cases, there are situations where it might be best to avoid.</p>

<p>Do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add too many actions.</li>
  <li>use if the webpage's purpose is straightforward and doesn't need extra features.</li>
  <li>use if it makes the user experience cluttered.</li>
  <li>add to very simple pages; it could make things too complicated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to</h2>

<p>Customise the shared content adding different <code>data</code> attributes to the <code>.js-share</code> anchor link elements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>data-social</code>:</strong> Specifies the social media platform for sharing (e.g., "facebook", "linkedin", "twitter", "mail").</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>data-text</code>:</strong> For social media sharing, particularly Twitter, specifies the text content to be shared along with the URL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>data-hashtags</code>:</strong> Specifically for Twitter sharing, provides hashtags to be included in the tweet content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>data-username</code>:</strong> For Twitter sharing, specifies the username to be included in the tweet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>data-subject</code>:</strong> Used for specifying the subject line in email sharing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
