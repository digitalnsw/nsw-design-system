## Guidance

Global alerts display across the top of the entire site to convey important information to the users.

### When to use this component

Use Global Alerts to attract the attention of the user for important messages, or to encourage an action. They can also be used for messages or actions that are relevant to the entire product or system, not just a feature or page.

Do:

* Use clear, concise easy to understand language, to minimise cognitive load.
* Use at the upper most part of the screen, before the masthead.
* **Reserve the use of the critical alert for circumstances which warrant it.**

### When not to use this component

Global alerts are purposefully created not initiated by a user interaction or system event. 

### How this component works

Global alerts are designed to capture the attention of the user in a deliberately intrusive way.  They persist over a session, contain the alert text and optional buttons, and are dismissible by the user by clicking the close icon.  

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
