Global alerts display across the top of an entire site to convey important information to users.

## Using global alerts

* Global alerts are designed to capture the attention of the user in a deliberately intrusive way
* Global alerts persist over a session but are user dismissible
* Global alerts are purposefully created and not initiated by a user interaction or system event

### Global alert states

Global alerts are styled according to their purpose:

* **Default alert** - Used to convey non-critical important information
* **Critical alert** - Used to convey critical information
* **Light alert** - Used as an alternative to the blue default on sites where blue features prominently

### When to use global alerts:

* use to attract the attention of the user for important messages, or to encourage an action
* use for messages or actions that are relevant to the entire product or system, not just a feature or page

Do:

* use clear, concise easy to understand language, to minimise cognitive load.
* use at the upper most part of the screen, before the masthead.
* reserve the use of the critical alert for circumstances which warrant it.

## When to avoid

Do not display in response to an action initiated by a user interaction or system event.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
