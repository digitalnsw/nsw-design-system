<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Use the date input component to let users enter a date they already know such as their date of birth, or a date they can enter without needing a calendar. It consists of three separate text fields grouped together, prompting users to enter the day, month, and year individually.</p>

<p>This is the easiest way for users to enter dates they know well because it allows for precise input and reduces the chances of making mistakes.</p>

<p>Do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjust the order of day, month, and year fields according to the regional format familiar to your users.</li>
  <li>Accept month names written out in full or abbreviated form (for example, ‘january’ or ‘jan’) as some users may enter months in this way.</li>
  <li>Ensure each field is clearly labeled. It’s important that date and month are clearly distinguished to ensure correct date entry</li>
  <li>use hint text to show the expected date format, for example, ‘07 11 2022’. Make sure that any example dates you use in hint text are valid for the question being asked.</li>
  <li>use a "text" vs "numeric" input type.</li>
  <li>limit individual field character length.</li>
  <li>require a four-digit year to avoid potential confusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>auto-advance focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.</li>
  <li>use placeholder text as it disappears when the user starts typing and may not be accessible to all users.</li>
  <li>use without a form label or hint text specifying the expected date format.</li>
  <li>use visual separators between fields.</li>
  <li>disable copy and paste.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to avoid</h3>
<p>Don't use a date input:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when asking users for multiple dates, such as a range, or a start and finish date (use date picker instead)</li>
  <li>if users are unlikely to know or cannot easily find the exact date of the event you're asking about.</li>
  <li>for scenarios where only an approximate date is needed, like a month or a year without a specific day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How this component works</h2>

<p>The three fields in the date input component are grouped together in a <code>fieldset</code> with a <code>legend</code> that describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. The legend is usually a question, such as 'What is your date of birth?'.</p>

<p>Use the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute on the date input component when you're asking for a date of birth. This allows browsers to autofill the information on a user's behalf if they've entered it previously.</p>

<p>The year input is set to accept only a four-digit number while the month and day inputs can accept up to a two-digit number.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
