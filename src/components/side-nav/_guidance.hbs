title: Side navigation
layout: blank-layout.hbs

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Side navigation displays a users current position in the content hierarchy past the main nav, and enables them to move between sections and related content.</p>
<p><strong>Single level navigation (sibling navigation)</strong></p>
<p>Navigation that shows only the pages on the same level of content hierarchy. This allows the user to navigate horizontally. It is ideal for a stepped process, or a journey along a path.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple level navigation</strong></p>
<p>Displaying multiple levels so a user can navigate vertically through content hierarchy. When a parent section is selected it expands to display the children. Parent sections remain bolded while the current selection is indicated by the active background colour. </p>

<h2>How this component works</h2>
<p>Side navigation supports four levels of nesting along with an accompanying heading. For visual hierarchy, each level of nesting is indented.</p>
<p>On mobile and smaller viewports, the side navigation is displayed through the main site navigation, otherwise called the hamburger menu.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
