title: Side navigation
layout: blank-layout.hbs

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the side navigation to allow users to find other pages within a section of a site. This will enable the user to see related pages and click though without having to go back.</p>
<p><strong>Section heading with single level navigation</strong></p>
<p>Single level (or sibling) navigation shows only the pages on the same level of content hierarchy. This allows the user to navigate horizontally. It is ideal for a stepped process, or a journey along a path.</p>
<p><strong>Section heading with multiple levels of navigation</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to allow the user to navigate down multiple levels of navigation in the same place, use this pattern. When a new section is selected, the new page will load with any child pages displaying within the hierarchy of the menu.</p>

<h2>How this component works</h2>
<p>The side nav can be used to show multiple levels of navigation. By default it supports three levels of nesting along with an accompanying heading.</p>
<p>For visual hierarchy, each level of nesting is indented 16px.</p>
<p>On mobile and smaller viewports, the side navigation is displayed through the main site navigation, sometimes called the hamburger menu.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
