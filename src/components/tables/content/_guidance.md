Tables provide a structured way to display information in rows and columns that make it easier for users to scan, sort and compare information.

## Using tables

Use tables to display large data sets that share common attributes to make it easier for users to scan, sort, and compare.

Do:

* left align table contents with the exception of numerical data, to facilitate easy scanning
* right align numerical data and apply mono-spacing for easier scanning and comparison
* display content in a way that is meaningful, such as ordering by hierarchy or alphabetically. Organise contents with the most important/relevant from top to bottom or left to right
* use a caption to describe the table's contents. The caption may be displayed at the top if required
* use borders to increase readability of content-dense tables
* favour wrapping over truncating content. Multiple items starting with the same word may appear the same when truncated.
* customise the table width for greater legibility. Tables with sparse, widely separated data are hard to scan and read.

## When to avoid

Donâ€™t use the tables to layout content on a page. You can combine other patterns for displaying your content.

## How this component works

At smaller breakpoints, the tables scroll horizontally by default.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
