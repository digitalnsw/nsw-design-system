## Guidance

Tables provide a structured way to display information in rows and columns that make it easier for users to scan, sort and compare information.

### When to use this component

Use tables to display large data sets that share common attributes and to logically structure content and make it easier to scan, sort and compare.

Do: 

* Left align table contents with the exception of numerical data, to facilitate easy scanning.
* Right align numerical data and apply mono-spacing for easier scanning and comparison.
* Display content in a way that is meaningful, such as ordering by hierarchy or alphabetically. Organise contents with the most important/relevant from top to bottom or left to right.
* Use a caption to describe the table's contents. The caption may be displayed at the top if required.
* Use borders to increase readability of content-dense tables.
* Favour wrapping over truncating content. Multiple items starting with the same word may appear the same when truncated.
* Customise the table width for greater legibility. Tables with sparse, widely separated data are hard to scan and read. 

### When not to use this component

Donâ€™t use the tables to layout content on a page. You can combine other patterns for displaying your content.

### How this component works

At smaller breakpoints, the tables scroll horizontally by default.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
