<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use a hero banners to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>introduce and give context to the product or service</li>
  <li>communicate and drive users to a specific call to action</li>
  <li>present an overview of the page’s most important content or primary message</li>
</ul>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>only use on a home page or category/landing page. Overuse may decrease their effectiveness and lead to ‘banner blindness.’</li>
  <li>use simple and concise messaging</li>
  <li>use clear call to actions that aligns to the message or task</li>
  <li>only use images where they add value to the content and support the message</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to avoid</h2>
<p>Do not use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to replace titles on content pages, instead use H1 typography styles</li>
  <li>for sites or products where the primary navigation of your users is via search, consider <a href="/components/hero-search/index.html" aria-label="Hero search component">Hero Search</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Building heros</h2>
<p>Heros layout UI elements to communicate a focused message. They should feature a primary message and/or call to action, and can be accompanied by supporting content such a images or graphics.</p>
<p>Our base component shows example layouts, and are designed to adapt to your content. If these do not meet your user needs (ie. content type or layout), you can use the foundational elements of the design system to build your own in a similar style.</p>

<h2>Image display options</h2>
<p>The default image uses our longstanding covered, centred styling. If needed, you can choose a left‑aligned covered layout or a no‑crop option that shows the full image without obscuring content.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cover + centre</strong> (default): the image fills the box and <em>will crop as needed</em>. Best for photography where the focal point is near the centre. Use <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cover + left</strong>: the image fills the box and <em>will crop as needed</em>, keeping the focal area to the left. Use when the subject sits on the left and is getting cropped in the default view. Use <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image--cover-left</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>No crop (fit)</strong>: the entire image is shown using <code>object-fit: contain</code>—it is <em>never cropped</em>. Because the hero image area has a fixed height, the image may not touch both edges on every screen width; expect empty space (letterboxing) unless the image and container aspect ratios match. Use <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image--no-cover</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Available classes:</strong> <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image</code>, <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image--cover-left</code>, <code>.nsw-hero-banner__image--no-cover</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only when the image and container aspect ratios match will the full image appear edge‑to‑edge. Otherwise, the “No crop (fit)” option will show space to preserve the full image without cropping.</p>
