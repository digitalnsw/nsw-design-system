Link lists let users navigate to related content.

## Using link lists

Use link lists to display a list of navigation items to provide a quick way for users to navigate to a content area.

Do:

* keep links short and intuitive. Links that are too long (more than 1 line) make it difficult for users to scan.
* use the [writing guide](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/guides/content-101) to ensure you keep the tone active.

## When to avoid

Do not

* use a link list for pages that aren't related as this is likely to confuse users
* use a link list in a transactional service or a form
* use as an on-page navigation pattern.

## How this component works

Navigation items are separated from each other by a fine line, grouping related links, but keeping the individual links separate.

Forward arrows are used to help suggest that each of the list items is a link.

The entire row is clickable.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
