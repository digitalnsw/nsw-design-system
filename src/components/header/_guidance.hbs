<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Header sits under the Masthead on all NSW Government websites, products and services.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the Header:</p>

<h3>Masterbrand</h3>
<p>The Masterbrand Header contains the NSW Government logo and site name, with optional descriptor and search. The descriptor can be used to give greater context to users where needed, for example to identify the Department of Agency to which the site is part of.</p>

<h3>Co-brand</h3>
<p>The Co-brand Header contains the NSW Government logo and Co-branded logo (max 76px in height), with optional search. Depending on your logoâ€™s ratio, the appropriate Co-brand header should be chosen:</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal stacked:</strong> On mobile the NSW Government and Co-brand logo will appear side by side. Consider this option when the Co-branded logo <strong>does not exceed</strong> 130px in width when at 48px in height. If it does, always test to ensure it does not overlap Search and Menu functions on smaller devices.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical stacked:</strong> On mobile the NSW Government will appear on top of the Co-brand logo. Consider this option when the Co-branded logo <strong>does exceed</strong> 130px in width when at 48px in height. </p>

<h3>NSW Government Logo</h3>
<p>The NSW Government logo reinforces the connection to NSW Government and should always appear in the top left to create a consistent experience across digital product or services. It should appear no smaller than 76px and never smaller than the Co-branded logo.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>The search displays on the right hand side and can be omitted if not required.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
