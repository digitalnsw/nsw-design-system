## Customisation

### Logos

By default, the lock-up is a co-brand of the NSW Government logo and and the department or agency name. If using the default, ensure the NSW Government logo remains the same size and your logo does not exceed 60px in height. The lock-up between the NSW Government logo and your logo must remain the same. See the [logo placement page](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-design-system/style/logo) for more details.

If you have a brand exemption, replace the logo with your own. You need to use a maximum height of 60px.
