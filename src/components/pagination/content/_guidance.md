Pagination indicates to a user that a list of items has been split in to multiple pages.

## Using pagination

Use pagination to separate large lists of content, such as search results or an index, into smaller lists that are easier to interact with.

## How this component works

Pagination allows users to see how many pages there are, which page you are currently viewing, and how to navigate to other pages. Users can click the next and back links to navigate. Clicking on a page number will take you to the selected page.

The pattern provides the visual assets required for pagination. The business rules required to display the content will be defined by the individual technology the product or service is being delivered through.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
