  "content": "<p>A service is any activity that helps someone complete a task. With that in mind, all public servants – whether they work in digital, communications, policy or operations – are involved in designing services.</p><p>Services are groups of transactions, activities or information that work together. They might take place online or offline.</p><p>Government services often require people to go through the service in the way that government designs it, and often this design is not simple or easy to follow.</p><p>A service may need smaller products to meet user needs. If these products are delivered by different parts of government that are working in different ways it can make it harder for the user to do what they need to do.</p><p>This is why we need to design together to deliver the whole experience.</p><p>Proceeding with the service design process will help your team build services that solve a real customer need, based on evidence. </p>",
