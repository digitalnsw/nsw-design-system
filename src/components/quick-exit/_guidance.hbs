title: Quick exit
layout: blank-layout.hbs

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>A standardised quick exit button offers a discreet and accessible safety mechanism, allowing users to swiftly leave sensitive content with a single click. This control is designed to be placed inside the global sticky container so it is consistently available where rapid exit is required.</p>

<h2>Design rationale</h2>
<p>The quick exit button is designed with visibility, predictability, and consistent appearance in mind to reinforce user trust and recognition, especially under stress. Clear visibility ensures users can quickly locate the button when needed, predictable behaviour guarantees that the button performs as expected, and a consistent appearance across NSW Government websites helps users immediately identify the feature in critical moments.</p>

<p>Use quick exits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate the quick exit control inside the global sticky container described in the layout guide.</li>
  <li>Ensure it is clearly labelled and contrasts sufficiently with the background for easy visibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the quick exit button when a user's safety or privacy could be at risk if they remain on the page.</li>
  <li>Ensure that clicking the button immediately redirects the user to a safe and neutral destination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Avoid</h3>
<p>Do not display the quick exit button as a response to regular user interactions or system events that are not associated with an immediate safety risk. The component should not be used to simply navigate between pages or for typical exit actions.</p>

<h2>Implementation and placement</h2>
<h3>Recommended approach</h3>
<p>add the Quick Exit element manually in your page layout inside the global sticky container. This ensures the control is always present and its visibility can be governed by your CMS (for example, show it only on specific templates or when certain flags are set).</p>

<p>Use server-rendered HTML so the control exists without JavaScript. A simple, accessible pattern is an inline button or link that sends users to a neutral destination immediately:</p>

{{#>_docs-example hidden="true" open="true" code="html"}}
&lt;div class="nsw-sticky-container"&gt;

  &lt;!-- Other sticky components (for example, Cookie consent banner) can also appear here --&gt;

  &lt;a
    class="nsw-quick-exit nsw-quick-exit__dark"
    href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/"
    data-options='{
      "safePageTitle": "NSW Government",
      "enableEsc": true,
      "enableCloak": true
    }'
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    id="nsw-quick-exit"
    aria-describedby="nsw-quick-exit__desc"
  &gt;
    &lt;span
      id="nsw-quick-exit__desc"
      class="nsw-quick-exit__description-text"
    &gt;
      Leave quickly using this banner or press &lt;kbd&gt;Esc&lt;/kbd&gt; 2 times.
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nsw-quick-exit__exit-text"&gt;Exit now&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{/_docs-example}}

<p>If the browser blocks pop‑ups when attempting to open the safe URL in a new tab, the Quick Exit control will automatically fall back to opening the safe destination in the current tab instead.</p>

<h3>Fallback JavaScript setup (only if manual placement is not possible)</h3>
<p>If you cannot render the element via your CMS/layout, there is a programmatic option that injects and wires up the control at runtime. This approach <strong>requires JavaScript</strong>; users without JS will not see the feature.</p>

{{#>_docs-example hidden="true" open="true" code="js"}}
window.NSW.QuickExit.init({
  safeUrl: 'https://www.nsw.gov.au/',
  safePageTitle: 'NSW Government',
  description: 'Select &lt;strong&gt;Exit now&lt;/strong&gt; or press the &lt;kbd&gt;Esc&lt;/kbd&gt; key 2 times.',
  theme: 'dark',
  enableEsc: true,
  enableCloak: true,
});
{{/_docs-example}}

<p>Use the programmatic method only when server rendering is unavailable; prefer the manual layout approach for progressive enhancement and guaranteed visibility.</p>

<h3>Placement</h3>
<p>You must place the Quick Exit control inside the global sticky container. described in the <a href="/core/layout/index.html#global-page-structure">Global page structure</a> guide so it remains consistently available without obstructing content.</p>
<p>This is because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prevents conflict with genuinely critical information in the header, including global alerts.</li>
  <li>Allows the control to run alongside other bottom-sticky elements (for example, the Cookie consent banner) so they stack as block elements when both are initialised.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Elements within the component</h2>

<h3>Exit button label</h3>
<p>The label on the exit button (<code>Exit now</code>) is <strong>not</strong> customisable. This intentional design choice ensures consistent wording and recognisability across all NSW Government websites. Consistency helps users quickly identify the quick exit feature, particularly in stressful or time-sensitive situations where they may need to leave a page rapidly.</p>

<h3>Safe page destination</h3>
<p>The quick exit button redirects users to neutral, non-sensitive sites such as <a href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/">nsw.gov.au</a> or <a href="https://www.bom.gov.au/">bom.gov.au</a>. These destinations are chosen because they provide safe, trusted, and non-controversial landing pages that do not expose users to additional risks or sensitive content. Redirecting to these sites helps users quickly leave potentially harmful situations while maintaining their privacy and security.</p>

<span class="nsw-tag nsw-tag--info nsw-m-top-md" aria-hidden="true">JS-required</span>
<h3 class="nsw-m-top-sm">Cloak mode (progressive enhancement)</h3>
<p>When the Quick Exit is triggered with JavaScript enabled, the page is immediately concealed by applying <code>display: none</code> to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>Without JavaScript, the manual link will still navigate to the safe destination, but no visual cloaking is applied.</p>

<span class="nsw-tag nsw-tag--info nsw-m-top-md" aria-hidden="true">JS-required</span>
<h3 class="nsw-m-top-sm">Double escape key feature (progressive enhancement)</h3>
<p>The Quick Exit component includes an optional keyboard shortcut that allows users to trigger the exit using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key twice in quick succession. This feature provides an alternative method for users who cannot or prefer not to use the mouse. When enabled (via <code>enableEsc: true</code>), the system listens for two consecutive <kbd>Esc</kbd> presses within a one-second window to activate the same exit behaviour as the main button.</p>
<p>This accessibility feature is particularly valuable for users who require keyboard navigation or need a discreet, rapid method to leave a page without drawing attention to their actions.</p>

<span class="nsw-tag nsw-tag--info nsw-m-top-md" aria-hidden="true">JS-required</span>
<h3 class="nsw-m-top-sm">Focus</h3>
<p>When JavaScript is enabled, the Quick Exit link becomes the first element reached when the user presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> for the first time on the page. This ensures the control is immediately accessible to keyboard users without forcing focus on page load. When JavaScript is disabled, normal source‑order focus behaviour applies.</p>

<h2>Responsiveness & zoomed states</h2>
<p>The Quick Exit control is responsive and designed to work with the sticky container at up to 400% zoom. At smaller breakpoints or high zoom, the component presents a compact layout so it does not obscure page content. Ensure the page template reserves space for the sticky container and that the control’s label wraps when necessary to maintain readability.</p>

<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The browser history is not cleared when using the quick exit; users may still be able to navigate back.</li>
  <li>When JavaScript is unavailable, the manual link remains visible and functional, but no cloaking occurs.</li>
  <li>When using the optional programmatic approach, the feature is invisible to users without JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and designed to comply with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards. Full compliance depends on using and configuring the components correctly.</p>

<h3>Obstruction of content</h3>
<p>Obstruction of content in the footer is automatically handled by the global sticky container. Padding equal to the height of the sticky container is applied to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element to ensure that no page content is obscured by the Quick Exit control or other bottom‑sticky elements.</p>
<p>This component does not include WCAG 2.2 AAA support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-not-obscured-enhanced">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a>. At AAA level, focused elements must remain completely visible and unobscured by author-created content; this standard is not fully met by the sticky container implementation.</p>

<h3>Keyboard and focus</h3>
<p>The quick exit button is fully accessible via keyboard navigation. Focus styles are clearly visible, and keyboard users can activate the button using standard keys to ensure ease of use for all users.</p>

<h3>Screen reader support</h3>
<p>ARIA attributes and semantic HTML ensure the quick exit button is announced appropriately by screen readers, providing meaningful context and instructions for users who rely on assistive technologies.</p>

<h3>Colour and contrast</h3>
<p>The button’s colour scheme meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast requirements to ensure it is easily distinguishable against its background, improving visibility for users with visual impairments.</p>

<h3>Language and clarity</h3>
<p>Text labels and instructions use clear, simple language to facilitate quick understanding and reduce cognitive load, particularly important in stressful situations.</p>
