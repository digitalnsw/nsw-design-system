# Using this pattern

An accordion is a series of expandable vertical panels, designed to save space on a page by hiding content and revealing it as required. It is useful for the display of simple content and links. Accordions can work well for people who use a service regularly; who need to perform familiar tasks quickly.

## When to use this component

Only use an accordion if there’s evidence it’s helpful for users to:

* see an overview of multiple, related sections of content
* show and hide those sections as needed

Do not:

* Use the pattern without testing it first

## Accessibility
