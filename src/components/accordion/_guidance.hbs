<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Accordions can work well for people who use a service regularly, or who need to perform familiar tasks quickly.</p>
<p>Only use an accordion if there’s evidence it’s helpful for users to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>see an overview of multiple, related sections of content</li>
	<li>show and hide those sections as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>The details based accordion is the default and recommended implementation.</p>
<h3>When to avoid</h3>
<p>Test your content without an accordion first. Consider if it’s better to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>simplify and reduce the amount of content</li>
	<li>split the content across multiple pages</li>
	<li>keep the content on a single page, separated by headings</li>
	<li>use a list of links to let users navigate quickly to specific sections of content</li>
	<li>use the Tab component for users who need to switch quickly between 2 sections. Accordions push other sections down the page when they open, but tabs do not move which makes it easier to switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not:</p>
<ul>
	<li>use the accordion if the amount of content it would need to contain will make the page slow to load</li>
	<li>use accordions to split up a series of questions into sections. Use separate pages instead</li>
	<li>use with very short content, use lists or paragraphs</li>
	<li>use with very long content, use tabs or separate pages</li>
	<li>add any other UI elements within the header</li>
	<li>use where important information can be hidden and missed</li>
	<li>use an accordion to shorten a page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collapse all/Expand all</h3>
<p>The optional collapse all/expand all functionality allows users to perform the action to all accordions, reducing time and clicks to reach the required information. It can be removed or added as required.</p>
<p>This function should not be used to help users locate information within accordions. If a user is expanding multiple accordions because they are unsure of the content they contain, consider more descriptive titles or removing accordions all together and displaying the content separated by headings.</p>

<h3>Open accordion pane on page load</h3>
<p>By default, all panes in an accordion are closed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Details based accordion</strong>: render the item with the <code>open</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element. When JavaScript is available, the progressive enhancement layer will sync <code>aria-expanded</code> and <code>aria-hidden</code> as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy JavaScript accordion</strong>: add the <code>.nsw-accordion__open</code> class on the <code>.nsw-accordion__title</code> element. For accessibility reasons, a JavaScript initialisation function first opens all accordions by default, then closes those marked as closed. This ensures that when JavaScript is disabled, users can still access all content by default.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<p><strong>Use clear labels</strong></p>
<p>Accordions hide content, so the labels need to be clear. Ensure the headings used are brief and explicit about what is contained in the hidden panel. Intuitive headings help the user build a clear mental model of the content.</p>
<p><strong>Do not disable sections</strong></p>
<p>Accordions can be set open or closed. They can be configured to only allow 1 panel to be open at a time. Do not use with only 1 panel allowed to be open at once, if people need to compare items in different panels.</p>
<p>Disabling controls is normally confusing for users. If there is no content for a section, either remove the section or, if this would be confusing for your users, explain why there is no content when the section is opened.</p>
<p>Consider tabs if the user would likely need to flick between content sections.</p>

<h2 id="details-variation">Details variation (Recommended)</h2>
<p>The details based accordion (<code>.nsw-accordion--details</code>) is the default and recommended implementation. It uses native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements for the disclosure pattern, which provides built in semantics, keyboard support and state announcement for assistive technologies. This version delivers the core expand and collapse interaction without requiring JavaScript and is progressively enhanced when JavaScript is available.</p>

<h3>Why we included it</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Semantic and accessible</strong>: uses the browser's native disclosure control so screen readers understand the role and state without extra ARIA attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>No-JS friendly</strong>: the main interaction (opening and closing panels) works even when JavaScript is disabled or blocked.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong>: when JavaScript is present, we synchronise ARIA attributes and support optional "Expand all / Collapse all".</li>
  <li><strong>Future proof</strong>: relies on well supported HTML elements instead of hidden form controls, which reduces the risk of implementation errors by consumers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations and trade offs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Styling hooks are constrained</strong>: browsers retain some control over <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> behaviour and markers. While the Design System normalises the visual presentation, very heavy or unusual customisation of the header or marker is not supported.</li>
  <li><strong>Animation support varies between browsers</strong>: smooth height transitions for opening and closing rely on newer CSS capabilities. Where these are not available, some browsers will fall back to instant open and close rather than an animated transition.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus treatment is container based</strong>: due to how <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> receives focus, we apply focus styles at the header or container level. Implementers should avoid additional overflow or clipping on parent containers that would cut off the focus ring.</li>
  <li><strong>Programmatic control is limited without JS</strong>: to open or close panels in response to validation, routing or other application events, you must use the JavaScript progressive enhancement layer or the legacy JavaScript accordion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add the modifier class <code>.nsw-accordion--details</code> on the accordion container to render the details based variant.</li>
  <li>Use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> for each item and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> for the clickable header, following the markup in the examples.</li>
  <li>Optional: add a toolbar container <code>.nsw-accordion__toggle</code> with "Expand all" and "Collapse all" buttons. When JavaScript is available, these controls are wired up automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility and support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The details based accordion is recommended for most use cases because it combines strong accessibility with reduced JavaScript dependence.</li>
  <li>Some advanced animation or styling requirements may not be achievable with <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>. In those cases, consider the legacy JavaScript accordion.</li>
  <li>The details variant can safely coexist on the same page with the legacy JavaScript accordion without conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="legacy-js-variation">Legacy JS-core variation (Supported)</h2>
<p>The legacy JavaScript accordion (<code>.js-accordion</code>) is the original implementation and remains fully supported for backward compatibility and when advanced programmatic control or legacy behaviour is required.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version manages state entirely through JavaScript, handling <code>aria-expanded</code> and <code>aria-hidden</code> attributes and adding roles for assistive technology.</li>
  <li>Initialisation opens all accordions on page load before closing those that should remain closed, ensuring content is accessible when JavaScript is disabled.</li>
  <li>While this approach supports consistent behaviour across browsers, it introduces additional load operations that can affect performance compared to the details based solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and designed to comply with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards. Full compliance depends on using and configuring the components correctly. The details based accordion is the default implementation and meets these standards when implemented as intended, and the legacy JavaScript variant can also meet these standards when used correctly.</p>

<h3>Support for accessibility features</h3>
<p>The details based accordion prioritises performance and accessibility by using the native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements. Users get built in keyboard navigation and state announcement, and the component continues to work when JavaScript is disabled. The progressive enhancement layer adds optional ARIA attributes, single open behaviour and "Expand all / Collapse all" controls without changing the underlying semantics.</p>
<p>The legacy JavaScript accordion is retained as a supported implementation for cases requiring advanced scripting. It manages state entirely through JavaScript, handling <code>aria-expanded</code> and <code>aria-hidden</code> attributes and adding roles for assistive technology. Its initialisation process opens all accordions on page load before closing those that should remain closed, ensuring content accessibility when JavaScript is disabled. While effective, this approach can introduce additional load operations affecting performance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not add <code>aria-hidden</code> or <code>aria-expanded</code> attributes to the details based variant. These attributes are not needed for native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> elements, as their state is managed by the <code>open</code> attribute and is natively accessible to assistive technology.</li>
  <li>Without JavaScript, the details based accordion remains keyboard accessible through the native <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element.</li>
</ul>

<p>The details based accordion is the recommended solution for most cases. It delivers strong accessibility and performance by using native browser behaviour for interactivity and reducing JavaScript dependency, while still working with the same progressive enhancement layer. The legacy JavaScript version remains available when more specific styling or programmatic control is required.</p>
