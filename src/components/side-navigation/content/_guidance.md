## Guidance

A vertical list of links that shows the user their current position in the site hierarchy and enables them to navigate to other pages.

### When to use this component

Use the side navigation to allow users to find other pages within a section of a site. This will enable the user to see related pages and click though without having to go back.

**Section heading with single level navigation**

Single level (or sibling) navigation shows only the pages on the same level of content hierarchy. This allows the user to navigate horizontally. It is ideal for a stepped process, or a journey along a path.

**Section heading with multiple levels of navigation**

If you would like to allow the user to navigate down multiple levels of navigation in the same place, use this pattern. When a new section is selected, the new page will load with any child pages displaying within the hierarchy of the menu.

### How this component works

The side nav can be used to show multiple levels of navigation. By default it supports three levels of nesting along with an accompanying heading. 

For visual hierarchy, each level of nesting is indented 16px.

On mobile and smaller viewports, the side navigation is displayed through the main site navigation, sometimes called the hamburger menu.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
