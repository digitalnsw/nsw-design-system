## Guidance

The breadcrumb shows the location of a page, in relation to its parent pages. It allows users to navigate back through these pages with ease.

### When to use this pattern

Use breadcrumbs to give users context and a progressive sense of place. This helps the user to understand the site structure and facilitates discovery if they’ve landed on the page using search.

Do:

* Display in the top left of the main content area above the page title.
* Ensure you use the same labels and casing as the main IA.
* Use for large deep websites.

### When not to use this pattern

Do not:

* Use for progressive flows such as wizards.

### How this component works

Breadcrumbs show the current page location in the context of its parent pages, starting with the home link. 

Parent pages are visually treated to be easily understood as links. The label of the user’s current page is not a link. Chevrons are used between the labels to suggest a visual hierarchy.

For mobile resolutions (under 768px) the breadcrumb shows a link to the immediate parent and current page only.

## Accessibility

Breadcrumbs are a complementary way to navigate back through the site architecture.
