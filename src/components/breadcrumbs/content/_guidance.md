Breadcrumbs help users to understand where they are within a website’s structure.

## Using Breadcrumbs

Use the Breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.

Do:

* display in the top left of the main content area above the page title
* ensure you use the same labels and casing as the main IA

## When to avoid

Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

Breadcrumb navigation should be regarded as an extra feature and shouldn’t replace effective primary navigation menus.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.

## How this component works

Breadcrumbs are a navigational aid that display a user's location on a website as a row of links, usually located at the top of the page.

Breadcrumbs should:

* start with your ‘home’ page and end with the parent section of the current page
* display in the top left of the screen’s content area, above the page title
* reflect the section names of the IA and use chevrons between the names to suggest a visual hierarchy.

For mobile resolutions (under 768px), the breadcrumb shows a link to the immediate parent and current page only.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
