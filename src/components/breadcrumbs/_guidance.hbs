<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>display in the top left of the main content area above the page title</li>
	<li>reflect the names of the parent-level pages ensuring you use the same labels and casing as the main IA</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parent page</strong><br>Starts with the "Home" page and links users to parent-level pages in the IA</p>
<p><strong>Icon</strong><br>The chevrons between the names shows the visual hierarchy between pages.</p>
<p><strong>Current page</strong><br>Indicates the current page the user is viewing.</p>

<h3>When to avoid</h3>
<p>Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.</p>
<p>Breadcrumb navigation should be regarded as an extra feature and shouldn’t replace effective primary navigation menus.</p>
<p>If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.</p>

<h2>How this component works</h2>
<p>For mobile resolutions (under 768px), the breadcrumb shows a link to the immediate parent and current page only.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and designed to comply with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards, except where compliance is achieved through correct usage and configuration.</p>
