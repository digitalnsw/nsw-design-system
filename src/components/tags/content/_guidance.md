## Guidance

A tag is an interactive element containing a keyword or phrase used to categorise content.

### When to use this component

Tags help classify content for your users using keywords or phrases. They can also help users search for and find related content quickly and easily.

Use tags to:

* categorise content
* link to related content
* filter results

Users often confuse tags as buttons. Conduct user testing to make sure the way you use them is not causing confusion.

### How this component works

Tags are designed to look button-like, but are visually distinct from regular buttons. 

Each tag links users to a listing of all the content, or filters content, with that specific keyword or phrase. 

Clicking on a tag takes the user to a list page of all items tagged with that keyword or phrase. Tags can also be used to filter content on a page.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
