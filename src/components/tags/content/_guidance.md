A tag is an interactive element containing a keyword or phrase used to categorise content.

## Using tags

Tags help classify content for your users using keywords or phrases. They can also help users search for and find related content quickly and easily.

Use tags to:

* categorise content
* link to related content
* filter results

Users often confuse tags as buttons. Conduct user testing to make sure the way you use them is not causing confusion.

### When to avoid

Do not:

* Use to initiate an action, consider buttons
* Use to link to page content, consider text links

### How this component works

Each tag links users to a listing of all the content, or filters content, with that specific keyword or phrase.

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
