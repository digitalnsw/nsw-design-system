<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the main navigation to show the top-level detail of your Information Architecture (IA).</p>
<p><strong>Default main navigation</strong></p>
<p>You can use the main navigation without the mega menu. In this instance the side navigation should also be used on sites greater than 1 level deep. This will allow your users to find what they are looking for beyond the top level.</p>
<p><strong>Mega menu</strong></p>
<p>On sites with more than 1 level of navigation, you can provide more context with a mega menu. The mega menu allows you to expand the selected navigation item to show its child pages. If you are using the mega menu, an additional level of your IA is displayed. A chevron indicates when a mega menu is available.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>make sure labels are clear, logical and predictable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How this component works</h2>
<p>The main navigation is horizontal. It displays at the top of your site. Users can navigate between related sections of content, showing one section at a time. Because the main navigation is a horizontal list, it wonâ€™t support a large number of items. When defining your IA, this will need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller devices</strong></p>
<p>On smaller devices, the main navigation displays as a hamburger menu, where all levels are available.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
