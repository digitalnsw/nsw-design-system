<h4 id="sizing-master-brand">Sizing</h4>
<p>The NSW Government Waratah logo should be 76px in height on large screens (≥ 992px), and 48px in height on small screens (< 991px) and should never be smaller than the support logos.</p>

<h3 id="masterbrand-descriptors">Masterbrand descriptors</h3>
<p>Use Masterbrand descriptors as text-only links when an agency, department, program, or campaign within the NSW Government, classified as a Masterbrand entity, needs to be recognised.</p>
<p>In cases where the NSW Government Waratah logo is not used in the support section, display a 'NSW Government' descriptor label instead.</p>

<h3 id="support-logos">Support logos</h3>
<h4 id="arrangement">Arrangement</h4>
<p>Order is based on hierarchy of the NSW Government Brand Framework:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Masterbrand (used as a text-only link descriptor)</li>
  <li>Co-brand</li>
  <li>Endorsed</li>
  <li>Independent</li>
  <li>Stand-alone</li>
</ol>
<p>External brand logos can also be included after the NSW Government logos.</p>
<p>The arrangement of logos follows the hierarchy of the NSW Government Brand Framework, however when necessary, they can be re-ordered  based on the scale of funding or contribution.</p>
