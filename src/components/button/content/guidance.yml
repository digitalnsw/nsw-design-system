<h2>Using buttons</h2>
<p>Buttons should be used when the user performs an action, and should describe what happens when pressed. Examples of button contexts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submitting a form</li>
  <li>Cancelling a transaction</li>
  <li>Saving information</li>
  <li>Making a payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buttons vs. links</h3>
<p>Buttons should be used if there is an <em>action</em> performed. For navigating users to different pages, use a text link instead.</p>
<h2>Button states</h2>
<p>Buttons are styled according to their purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary</strong> buttons are for the page's primary user action (call to action)</li>
  <li><strong>Highlight</strong> buttons can be coloured with your brand colour and used in place of primary buttons</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary</strong> buttons are used for call to action other than the primary</li>
  <li><strong>Disabled</strong> buttons can be used if research shows that it helps users understand the screen</li>
</ul>
