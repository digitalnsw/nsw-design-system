<h2>Usage</h2>   
<p>Buttons should be used when the user performs an action, and should describe what happens when pressed. Examples of button contexts include:  
</p> 
<ul>
  <li>submitting a form</li>   
  <li>cancelling a transaction</li>   
  <li>saving information</li>   
  <li>making a payment</li> 
</ul>   

<h3>Buttons vs. links</h3>   
<p>Buttons should be used if there is an <em>action</em> performed. For navigating users to different pages, use a text link instead.</p> 
<h3>Button states</h3> 
<p>Buttons are styled according to their purpose:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Primary</strong> buttons are for the page's primary user action (call to action)</li> 
  <li><strong>Secondary</strong> buttons are used for call to action other than the primary</li> 
  <li><strong>Danger</strong> buttons are NSW Primary Highlight and used to confirm a destructive action, such as delete. </li> 
  <li><strong>Disabled</strong> buttons can be used if research shows that it helps users understand the screen</li> 
</ul>
