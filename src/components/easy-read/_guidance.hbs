  <li>explain one idea per sentence or paragraph</li>
  <li>include supportive images that reinforce the message</li>
  <li>ensure the content is meaningful, accurate, and respectful</li>
  <li>test with people who use Easy Read to ensure effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to use Easy Read</h3>

<ul>
  <li>communicating essential or public-facing information that affects people's lives</li>
  <li>writing about rights, safety, or access to services</li>
  <li>engaging people with intellectual disability or cognitive impairments</li>
</ul>

<h3>When not to use</h3>
<p>Do not use Easy Read when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you are writing internal or technical documentation</li>
  <li>the information requires complex detail that cannot be simplified without loss of meaning</li>
  <li>you are writing for audiences who do not benefit from simplified content</li>

<h2>How this component works</h2>
<p><strong>Text and layout</strong></p>
<p>Easy Read content should follow a consistent and structured layout. Key practices include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using a large, easy-to-read font (minimum 14pt)</li>
  <li>left-aligning all text, without justified spacing</li>
  <li>including generous spacing between lines and sections</li>
  <li>avoiding tables, dot points, or dense paragraphs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>
<p>Images are an important part of Easy Read. They must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>directly relate to and support the accompanying text</li>
  <li>appear on the left side of the page, next to the relevant sentence</li>
  <li>be simple, clear, and easy to interpret</li>
  <li>avoid decorative use that does not add meaning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>File format</strong></p>
<p>Easy Read documents should be published as accessible PDFs and made available alongside standard versions. Ideally, label the link clearly as "Easy Read."</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>Use these page templates to create Easy Read content using this component:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/templates/content/easy-read.html" target="_blank">Easy Read Article Template (Illustrations)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/templates/content/easy-read-photos.html" target="_blank">Easy Read Article Template (Photos)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>This component supports WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility requirements. Easy Read is not a replacement for accessible HTML but should be provided in addition to standard content. Ensure that Easy Read files are accessible PDFs with correct reading order, alt text for images, and searchable text.</p>
